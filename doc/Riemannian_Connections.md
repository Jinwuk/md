Riemannian Connections
===================

## Definition :  Connection is compatible
Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold with an affine connection $\nabla$, and Riemannian metric $\langle , \rangle$.
A connection is said to be compatible with the metric, when for any smooth curve c and any pair of parallel vector fields P and P’ along c, we have $\langle P, P' \rangle = \textit{constant}$.

평행한 두 벡터필드의 Riemannian metric이 constant 이면 Connection is compatible.

이 때문에  if $\nabla$, is compatible with $\langle , \rangle$, then **Inner product의 미분은 일반적인 Chain Rule을 따른다.**
역도 성립한다. 이렇게

## Proposition : Differentiate a Riemannian metric under a compatible connection
Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. A connection $\nabla$ on $M$ is compatible with a metric if and only if for any vector fields $V, W$ along the differential curve $c:I \rightarrow M$ we have
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\langle V, W \rangle = \langle \frac{DV}{dt}, W \rangle + \langle V, \frac{DW}{dt} \rangle
$$

### Corollary



## Definition : Symmetric Connection
